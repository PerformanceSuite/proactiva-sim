# PROACTIVA Healthcare Simulation Platform - Project Vision

## Project Overview

PROACTIVA is building an AI-powered healthcare operations simulation platform that helps VA medical centers and other healthcare facilities test innovations before implementation. The platform simulates everything from simple KPI impacts to complex AI agents making thousands of healthcare delivery decisions.

### Core Vision
- **Phase 1 (Current)**: Interactive dashboard for testing innovation scenarios (VR therapy, AR tools, etc.)
- **Phase 2 (Next)**: AI agents simulating patient journeys and healthcare operations
- **Phase 3 (Future)**: Full digital twin of healthcare facilities with predictive capabilities

### Key Features to Implement
1. Real-time healthcare KPI simulation
2. VA-specific metrics and workflows
3. Innovation impact modeling (VR/AR/AI/Robotics)
4. 3D facility visualization
5. Scenario saving and comparison
6. ROI calculations
7. AI agent simulation framework (Phase 2)

- Mental health access rates
- Service-connected disability processing
- Community care referrals and costs
- Suicide prevention screening rates
- Homeless veteran outreach effectiveness

### Innovation Focus Areas
- PTSD and mental health (VR therapy)
- Prosthetics and assistive technology
- Telehealth for rural veterans
- AI-powered triage for crisis intervention
- Mobile units for homeless veterans

## AI-Powered Simulation (Phase 2 Vision)

### Concept: Agent-Based Healthcare Simulation

Instead of simple mathematical formulas, implement AI agents that:

1. **Patient Agents**
   - Have conditions, preferences, urgency levels
   - Make decisions about seeking care
   - Navigate the healthcare system
   - Respond to wait times and quality

2. **Provider Agents**
   - Have specialties, efficiency rates, schedules
   - Make treatment decisions
   - Use available tools (VR, AR, AI)
   - Experience fatigue and satisfaction

3. **System Agents**
   - Scheduling algorithms
   - Resource allocation
   - Triage decisions
   - Quality monitoring

### AI Simulation Features to Research

1. **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**
   - Agents learn optimal strategies over time
   - Emergent behaviors from simple rules
   - Can discover non-obvious optimizations

2. **Digital Twin Technology**
   - Real-time synchronization with actual facility
   - Predictive capabilities
   - What-if scenario testing

3. **Large Language Model Integration**
   - Natural language scenario descriptions
   - Automated insight generation
   - Conversational interface for exploring results

4. **Monte Carlo Simulations**
   - Run thousands of scenarios automatically
   - Statistical confidence intervals
   - Risk assessment

## Questions for Product Development

1. Which VA facilities should we model first?
2. What are the most critical metrics for Kevin's demo?
3. Should we integrate with actual VA data systems?
4. How detailed should the AI simulation be for Phase 2?
5. What innovations beyond VR/AR should we include?
