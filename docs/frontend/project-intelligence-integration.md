# Project Intelligence Dashboard Integration

## Overview

The Project Intelligence System has been successfully integrated into the main PROACTIVA dashboard as a new tab, providing comprehensive organizational intelligence capabilities alongside the existing healthcare simulation features.

## Integration Details

### Dashboard Structure

The Project Intelligence feature has been added to the main Dashboard component located at:
```
proactiva-simulation/src/components/Dashboard/Dashboard.jsx
```

### New Navigation Tab

A new tab has been added to the main navigation:
- **Tab ID**: `intelligence`
- **Label**: "Project Intelligence" 
- **Icon**: Search (from Lucide React)
- **Position**: 4th tab (between ROI Analysis and Settings)

### Component Location

The ProjectIntelligence component is located at:
```
proactiva-simulation/src/components/ProjectIntelligence/
├── ProjectIntelligence.jsx    # Main component
└── index.js                   # Export module
```

## Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture

```jsx
import ProjectIntelligence from '../ProjectIntelligence/ProjectIntelligence';

// Added to navigation array
const navItems = [
  { id: 'overview', label: 'Overview', icon: BarChart3 },
  { id: 'scenarios', label: 'Scenarios', icon: Save },
  { id: 'roi', label: 'ROI Analysis', icon: FileBarChart },
  { id: 'intelligence', label: 'Project Intelligence', icon: Search }, // NEW
  { id: 'settings', label: 'Settings', icon: Settings }
];

// Added to view rendering
{activeView === 'intelligence' && (
  <ProjectIntelligence />
)}
```

### Layout Integration

The Project Intelligence component has been styled to match the dashboard's design system:

- **Container**: `space-y-6` for consistent spacing with other dashboard sections
- **Header Card**: White background with border, matching other dashboard cards
- **Tab Container**: Integrated tab system with blue accent color
- **Content Area**: Padded content area within the tab container

### State Management

The Project Intelligence component maintains its own internal state for:
- Active tab selection (`overview`, `duplicates`, `synergies`, `vendors`, `insights`)
- Selected project details for drill-down views
- Mock data for demonstration purposes

## Data Structure

### Mock Data Examples

#### Duplicate Projects
```javascript
{
  id: 1,

  similarity: 85,
  potentialSavings: 250000,
  status: "active",
  description: "Multiple departments implementing separate telehealth solutions"
}
```

#### Synergy Opportunities
```javascript
{
  id: 1,
  projects: ["VR Therapy Program", "Mental Health Innovation Lab"],
  benefit: "Shared VR equipment and expertise",
  impact: "high",
  estimatedValue: 180000,
  departments: ["Psychiatry", "Research"]
}
```

#### Vendor Analysis
```javascript
{
  vendor: "TechHealth Solutions",
  contracts: 4,
